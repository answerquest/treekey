treekey
=======

￼The Tree key proposed is based on indian context, in particular : ‘Trees of Pune ‘ by Shrikant Ingalhalikar. The info is enriched by wikipedia.
the idea is to allow an observer, who is initiated into tree identification, has some exposure to botany, to follow a logical path to arrive close to identifying a tree.
A table of 500+ trees has been prepared.

It will be an exercise to associate the sequence of these logical steps with each of the trees.It is expected that many trees will have a unique sequence of steps. Those trees which have common sequence will need additional discriminating evidence/observation to be uniquely identified. ­ drafted by jitendra , to be vetted by Niranjan

Logic:
1. Linear logic : a sequence starting from shape of leaf etc and ending at identification. This
is what Treekey does
2. Parallel logic : A more efficient logic could be to put several features observations at a
time and thus narrow down the band of options and then follow a suitable logic of linear questions
The logical steps for tree key can be defined by

*Type of tree*
deciduous, evergreen

*Branches*
succulent, cylindrical, terete, slender, watery juice,

*The leaf*
Leaf Type: simple, uni­pinnate, multi­pinnate, digitate
Leaf attachment: alternate and opposite
Leaf shape: elliptic, lanceolate, linear, lobed, oblong, ovate
Feel of the leaf: papery, white silky beneath, spinous, needle like, shining, strongly odorous, leathery

*The stem and bark*
dark brown, deeply cracked, deeply grooved, smooth, armed, grey, scaly, fissured, crooked, whitish, flaky,

*Milky Juice*
￼yes or no

*The flower*
colour, fragrant or not, size, solitary, group, clusters,

*Pods*
flat, woody,

*The fruit*
colour, size, woody, smooth, rough, edible, figs, fleshy, hard, lobed, round, globose, oblong, conical, coiled, twisted, cylindrical,

*The seed*
colour, size, rough, white silky cotton,
